# Create KeePass Entry
Generate a new password and then store it into KeePass.  This command is assuming that we use a "MasterKey" (=password).  You can also work with a key file, windows user and combination of those.  But this command is just with a MasterKey.  Adoption to work with the keyfile is minimal.

## Prerequisites:
You need to install the module "PoShKeePass".  You can find it on github.
